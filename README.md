## Overview

Downtify is a self-hosted web app that turns Spotify and YouTube Music links into a tagged audio library. It never touches the Spotify API, and it needs no account and no Premium subscription. It also plays that library back, so what you download is one tab away from listening.

```
Spotify embed page  →  YouTube Music search  →  yt-dlp + ffmpeg + mutagen
   (metadata)             (audio match)            (download & tag)
```

1. **Metadata.** Track, album and playlist links are resolved from the public `open.spotify.com/embed` pages, so no Spotify credentials of any kind are needed.
2. **Audio match.** [`ytmusicapi`](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/) finds the best YouTube Music result by comparing durations. When there is no good match, standard YouTube is searched automatically ([details](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/how-it-works/#fallback-to-standard-youtube)).
3. **Download and tag.** [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) fetches the audio, `ffmpeg` converts it to the format you chose, and [`mutagen`](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/) embeds title, artist, album, year and cover art.

All of it runs inside a single Docker container. See **[How it works](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/how-it-works/)** for the full pipeline.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Download** | Spotify tracks, albums, playlists and artists (their releases and top songs); YouTube Music songs, albums, playlists and artists; free-text search; CSV imports from Soundiiz, TuneMyMusic and Exportify. MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG or OPUS at the bitrate you pick. See [Download settings](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/download-settings/) and [Library import](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/library-import/). |
| **Charts** | Browse Deezer's global "what's trending" chart — tracks (with a 30-second preview, downloadable straight from the list), plus albums, artists and playlists to explore. See [Charts](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/charts/). |
| **Finder** | Discover's search box: search Deezer, then explore an artist in Finder-style columns: their profile and bio, their whole discography, and any album's tracks with previews, ready to download. See [Finder](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/finder/). |
| **Tags and lyrics** | Title, artist, album, year and cover art embedded in every file. Plain and time-synced lyrics from LRCLIB and NetEase, tried in the order you choose. See [Lyrics](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/lyrics/). |
| **Playlist Monitor** | Watch Spotify or YouTube Music playlists and artists; new tracks and new releases download on a schedule you set. Artist watches can be limited to albums, singles or EPs, and to releases from now on. See [Playlist Monitor](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/playlist-monitor/). |
| **Built-in player** | Full-screen Now playing with synced lyrics, an editable queue, a sleep timer, keyboard shortcuts, media keys and a ten-band equalizer (experimental). See [Built-in player](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/player/). |
| **Liked songs** | Tap the heart on a song and a *Liked songs* playlist of everything you have liked appears, in Downtify and in your media server. See [Liked songs](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/liked-songs/). |
| **Podcasts** | Subscribe by RSS feed, Spotify link or name; new episodes download, tag and keep their resume position on their own. See [Podcasts](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/podcasts/). |
| **Discover** | Artists, albums and playlists you don't have yet, suggested from your library, liked songs and what you play — from Deezer first, with Spotify's picks added as they arrive, no account or API key. Artists and Deezer albums open in the Finder; preview any album's or playlist's songs before downloading, and hide any artist you never want suggested. See [Discover](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/discover/). |
| **Users & activity** | Sign in with a username and password; admins add accounts for the rest of the house, users get General, Apps and About settings of their own, and an activity log shows who signed in and who is playing what. See [Users & sign-in](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/users/). |
| **Mobile apps** *(experimental)* | Pair a phone app by QR code and stream your library to it — original quality or transcoded for mobile data — with offline copies and casting. The server side is ready; the Android app itself is [still in development](#downtify-for-android). See [Mobile apps](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/mobile-apps/). |
| **Library** | Albums, artists, playlists and tracks in a grid or a list, with filtering, multi-select and download as a ZIP. Create your own playlists (and rename them), and add songs from downloads or extra folders (imported Spotify/YouTube playlists stay read-only). **Existing music folders** import a collection you already have (tags stay on disk; artists are matched to the library). **Upgrade library** repairs small covers, missing lyrics and incomplete tags on music you already have, without re-downloading, and **Replace audio** swaps a wrongly matched song for the version you pick, keeping it in its playlists. Pick a real photo and banner for an artist from YouTube Music, Deezer, Spotify or your own upload. See [Library catalog](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/library-catalog/), [Existing music folders](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/external-library/), [Upgrade library](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/library-upgrade/), [Replace audio](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/replace-audio/) and [Artist photo & banner](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/artist-images/). |
| **Playlist files** | Standard M3U files that Jellyfin, Navidrome and Plex pick up, plus each playlist's own cover art, saved before its tracks. A flat folder layout or one folder per artist. See [M3U export](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/m3u-export/), [Playlist cover art](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/playlist-cover-art/) and [File organization](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/file-organization/). |
| **Integrations** | Optionally download from Soulseek through your own slskd server and mirror playlists into Navidrome, each with a **Test connection** button in Settings. See [slskd & Navidrome](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/slskd-navidrome/). |
| **Interface** | Light and dark themes, one layout from phone to widescreen, an installable app ([PWA](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/pwa/)), live download progress, update notices and eight languages. |

## Quick start

You only need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name downtify \
  -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
  -v downtify_data:/data \
  ghcr.io/henriquesebastiao/downtify
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), sign in as **`admin`** / **`downtify`**, change that password in **Settings → General** (or turn accounts off with `DOWNTIFY_DISABLE_AUTH=true` on a server only you can reach), then paste a link and start the download. Replace `/path/to/downloads` with the folder where you want your music.

`/downloads` holds your audio files and `/data` holds Downtify's database and settings. Keep both persistent, or settings, likes and playlist tracking are lost when the container is recreated.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  downtify:
    container_name: downtify
    image: ghcr.io/henriquesebastiao/downtify:latest
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - ./downloads:/downloads
      - downtify_data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  downtify_data:
```

To serve it on another port, set `DOWNTIFY_PORT` and map the same port (or choose it in **Settings → Server → Port** and change the mapping to match):

```yaml
ports:
  - '30321:30321'
environment:
  - DOWNTIFY_PORT=30321
```

The remaining deployment options (timezone, monitor sync time, cookies file, IPv4) are listed under **[Environment variables](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/getting-started/environment-variables/)**. Everything else is configured from **Settings** in the web interface.

### Home server platforms

| Platform | |
|----------|---|
| Umbrel | [Install on Umbrel](https://apps.umbrel.com/app/downtify) |
| CasaOS | [Install on CasaOS](https://casaos.zimaspace.com/) |
| HomeDock OS | [Install on HomeDock](https://www.homedock.cloud/apps/downtify/) |

## What you can paste in

| Input | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Spotify track, album, playlist or artist | `open.spotify.com/track/…` |
| YouTube Music playlist | `music.youtube.com/playlist?list=…` |
| YouTube Music artist | `music.youtube.com/channel/UC…` or `music.youtube.com/@artist` |
| YouTube or YouTube Music video | `youtube.com/watch?v=…` |
| Deezer track, album, playlist or artist | `deezer.com/track/…` |
| Free-text search | `The Night Owls Do I Still Recall` |
| Library export (CSV) | Soundiiz, TuneMyMusic, Exportify |

An artist link opens the artist's page, with their releases and a **Top Songs** button to pick from their most popular songs and download them, optionally as a playlist ([details](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/top-songs/)). Artists in your Library also get a **Top songs** tab with their first five Spotify top songs, kept in a per-artist file for a week, and a 30-second preview of each song you haven't downloaded yet; an artist's bio, genre and links are also filled in, in your language, in the background as their first track finishes downloading ([details](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/top-songs/#on-an-artists-library-page)). Artists can also be watched for new releases with the **Playlist Monitor** — just albums, singles or EPs if you like, and optionally only what comes out from now on, skipping the back catalogue. Deezer links can be downloaded but not watched.

## Downtify for Android

An Android app is being built: it pairs with your server by scanning a QR code from **Settings → Apps**, then browses your library, plays it in the original quality or a smaller one for mobile data, keeps songs on the phone for offline listening and casts to a Chromecast.

> [!WARNING]
> **The app is still in development and no version has been published yet** — there is nothing to install for now, and how it works may still change. The server side of it already ships with Downtify, which is why **Settings → Apps** is marked experimental.

Repository: **[henriquesebastiao/downtify-android](https://github.com/henriquesebastiao/downtify-android)**

Anything that talks to the server can be built against the same API — see the [mobile client contract](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/mobile-client-contract/).

## Troubleshooting

Most download problems share one cause: YouTube wants a signed-in session. Upload a `cookies.txt` in **Settings → YouTube cookies** and they usually go away. If YouTube still rate-limits you, raise *Delay between downloads*, lower *Parallel downloads*, then try `DOWNTIFY_FORCE_IPV4=1`.

See **[Troubleshooting](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/troubleshooting/)** for the full list of symptoms and fixes, and **[YouTube cookies](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/youtube-cookies/)** for how to export the file.

## Translations

The interface is available in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Turkish, Hungarian, Greek and Bulgarian. Switch language in **Settings → Language**; the choice is saved in the browser and applies without a reload.

### Contributing translations

Adding a language is a small change and needs no tooling beyond the existing Vite setup:

1. Copy `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.js` to a new file named after an [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) (`de.js`, `it.js`, `pt-PT.js`).
2. Translate the values. Keep the keys and placeholder tokens (`{count}`, `{name}`, `{file}`) unchanged, and set `language.name` to the language's native name.
3. Register the locale in `frontend/src/i18n/index.js`.

Missing keys fall back to English, so a partial translation is welcome. The full walkthrough, with the registration snippet and tips, is in **[Internationalization](https://henriquesebastiao.github.io/downtify/features/internationalization/)**.
